# Patchy

An end-to-end workflow for triaging and remediating security findings from multiple sources, using Kubernetes custom
resources as the state machine and GitHub issues as a human-facing projection.

## Key requirements

1. The solution ingests finding reports from GitHub Advanced Security (namely CodeQL findings), Google Cloud
   Security Command Center, and Wiz (Issues and Defend detections), and is tool-agnostic through a plugin
   architecture — including a `generic` provider through which any external HTTP process (a scheduled job over a
   warehouse store, say — sources that are not event-driven) delivers findings in patchy's own documented contract,
   receives verdict write-back, and serves as a context enhancer, any number of them side by side:
   - providers deliver findings to a single internet-facing receiver, each route authenticating on the provider's own
     terms — an HMAC over the raw body for GitHub, the OIDC token a Pub/Sub push subscription signs for Google Cloud,
     which cannot compute an HMAC at all, the shared bearer token a Wiz automation action carries, since it can
     only send static headers, and per-integration HMAC on the generic wildcard route (`/generic/<name>/webhooks`);
   - each alert is retrieved in full and folded into a `Finding` custom resource carrying all relevant context
     (advisories, rule, severity, locations, or the cloud resource it was raised against);
   - every Finding is projected to a GitHub tracking issue labelled with its source, its CVE/CWE/GHSA advisory
     identifiers, and its current phase — for humans and issue searches, never parsed back into state;
   - a source may also write the pipeline's verdict back to the tool it came from, so a finding dismissed here does
     not stay open there.
2. Multiple alerts of the same finding type accumulate into a single Finding for up to 1 hour — per repository for a
   code finding, per cloud resource for an infrastructure one, since that is what a repository is later resolved from.
3. Once the accumulation window closes and at least an hour has passed, the pipeline picks the finding up for
   automated analysis.
4. A context-enhancement stage runs over freshly opened findings:
   - it may pull information from a CMDB to gather ownership and infrastructure relationships, recorded as
     enrichments on the Finding and projected out as issue labels (attributes) and sticky comments (markdown);
   - the enhancement logic is a placeholder behind the `pkg/enhance` plugin seam, but the machinery — pick up a
     finding, enrich it, advance its phase — is real.
5. An investigation agent analyses each eligible finding:
   - the agent runtime downloads the finding contents into a consistent, templated markdown file;
   - the repository is provided as a SHA-pinned tree — investigation and remediation are guaranteed the same code;
   - `claude -p` is bootstrapped with a prompt to assess the finding; the agent has no internet access and no
     GitHub/API credentials of any kind;
   - the agent writes a report with parseable YAML frontmatter: `exploitability`, `likelihood`, and `impact`
     ratings (each `none|low|medium|high|critical` with a justification), a `recommendation`
     (`ignore` for false positives, `remediate` for agentic remediation, `manual` for human remediation),
     `priority`, `severity`, and a `confidence` value in [0, 1] — for `remediate`, the likelihood of full
     remediation without breaking functionality;
   - backwards-compatible fixes are always favoured; if a better-but-breaking solution exists the report says so
     and the pipeline holds for a human `/approve`;
   - a `remediate` verdict also suggests the model, token budget, and max turns for the remediation stage, which
     the controller clamps to operator-configured ceilings and an allowlist.
6. The investigation-controller routes each verdict:
   - the report is always projected onto the tracking issue, and the ratings feed a 0–100 scheduling priority
     (severity 30% / exploitability 30% / likelihood 20% / impact 20%, tunable);
   - `ignore` dismisses the GHAS alerts and closes the issue;
   - `manual` hands the finding to the repository owners for triage;
   - `remediate` below the confidence threshold (default 0.75) — or holding a breaking-change note — waits for a
     human `/approve` comment;
   - `remediate` at or above the threshold queues the finding for remediation.
7. Remediation runs in priority order under bounded concurrency: a second `claude -p` stage receives the finding
   markdown, the pinned repository tree, and the investigation report, under the clamped token budget and turn
   ceiling. It produces a summary report (frontmatter: `success`, `confidence`) and a `commit.sh` that commits the
   changeset.
8. The remediation-controller verifies the claim against the repository (commit.sh must run cleanly and leave real
   commits), replays the changeset through the GitHub API onto a `patchy/<finding>` branch, opens the pull request,
   and moves the finding to in-review. Merging is left to humans; the merge webhook completes the finding.
9. Completed findings are kept for a TTL (default 14 days) and then deleted; per-scope `FindingRollup` resources
   retain the all-time statistics (success rates, verdict mix, token and cost totals per repository, harness, and
   model) with exactly-once accounting.

## Architecture

Go, one module, separate binaries per concern (not monolithic), all hosted in Kubernetes. OpenTelemetry for
logging, tracing, and metrics; structured logging via `log/slog`.

**The source of truth is the Kubernetes API.** The `patchy.bitwisemedia.uk/v1alpha1` custom resources —
`Integration`, `Forge`, `Finding`, `Repository`, `Investigation`, `Remediation`, `FindingRollup` — carry all
pipeline state; etcd is the only state store. GitHub issues are a one-way, human-facing projection: labels and
comments are rendered from the Finding, and human actions (issue close, `/approve` comments, PR merge) flow back
in as webhook signals, never by re-parsing issue state.

The agent execution harness is adapted from evolve (harness builds argv, runner executes, harness parses stdout), as is
the model construct: a registry of canonical, provider-qualified model ids (`anthropic/claude-sonnet-5`,
`openai/gpt-5.3-codex`), each associating the harnesses that can run it with a preferred one. Claude (Anthropic models),
Codex (OpenAI models) and Copilot (both vendors', as every model's fallback rather than any model's preference) are the
built-in harnesses; the harness that runs a model is derived from the model, so the
investigation may choose a remediation model from any provider and the remediation controller routes it to the matching
harness — its own runner image, credential, and egress policy. Which harnesses are enabled is configuration, defaulting
to any whose credential is supplied. The finding handoff, both prompts, and both report contracts are templated and
consistent across the estate.

### Components

- **integration-controller** — the single internet-facing entry point, driven by `Integration` resources. Inbound:
  validates provider webhooks (per-Integration secrets: GitHub HMAC, Pub/Sub OIDC, Wiz bearer token, generic
  per-integration HMAC) and ingests
  scanner alerts into Findings through the `pkg/source` handler seam (accumulation, duplicate merge). Outbound: projects Findings to tracking issues
  (body, labels, enrichment and report comments) and applies human signals (close, `/approve`, PR merge/close)
  back onto Findings.
- **source-controller** — `Forge` + `Repository` reconcilers. Validates forge credentials, resolves
  each Repository to its covering Forge, pins the head SHA exactly once, downloads the forge's tarball archive at
  that SHA (pure HTTP; controllers carry no git binary), and serves it from an artifact endpoint agents fetch
  credential-lessly (unguessable URL, digest-verified).
- **context-controller** — the enhancer chain over freshly opened Findings (`pkg/enhance` plugins; CMDB
  placeholder, plus cloud lookups that resolve a cloud finding's repository from its resource's ownership
  labels/tags, whichever source ingested it — Cloud Asset Inventory configured by the `cloudAssetInventory` block
  on the `google-cloud` Integration, an AWS Config aggregator or Resource Explorer view configured by the
  `resourceTags` block on the `aws` Integration, Azure Resource Graph configured by the `resourceTags` block on
  the `azure` Integration, each read per enhancement). Writes Finding status and, set-once,
  `spec.repository` for a finding that arrived without one. Holds no GitHub credential; the cloud lookups use
  read-only ambient identity (workload identity / EKS Pod Identity / IRSA), never a Secret.
- **investigation-controller** — the gate (admits accumulated, aged findings; materializes the Repository and one
  immutable `Investigation` per attempt) and the analysis scheduler (bounded concurrency, severity order,
  verdict routing).
- **remediation-controller** — queue admission (approvals, revivals), the priority scheduler (bounded
  concurrency, aging against starvation), agent Job execution, changeset push + pull request (the only holder of
  a forge write credential), and the rollup/TTL loop.
- **agent-runner** — the in-pod coding-agent runtime: one stage per Job (`investigate` or `remediate`), reports
  as `PATCHY-EVENT:` JSONL on stdout. Never talks to GitHub or the Kubernetes API; a claude pod holds no
  credential at all (model traffic authenticates at the egress broker), a codex/copilot pod only its model key.
- **egress-broker** — the egress credential broker: the reverse proxy all claude model traffic goes through
  (Anthropic, Amazon Bedrock, GCP Vertex AI, Microsoft Foundry). Validates each agent pod's audience-bound
  projected ServiceAccount token via TokenReview, then injects or signs the model credential outbound — the one
  place model credentials and cloud workload identity live. Not a controller: no reconcilers, no leases.

### The state machine

`Finding.status.phase`: `Opened → Enhanced → Investigating → Queued → Remediating → InReview → Remediated`, with
`AwaitingApproval` before `Queued` when a human must approve, and `Dismissed` / `HandedOff` / `Failed` as the
other terminal phases (`HandedOff` is revivable by a later approval; `Failed` by a human retry, which recovers
the finding to the state it failed from — `Enhanced` for a failed investigation, `Queued` for a failed
remediation or an unmerged PR). A human may also mark a finding **expedited** (`spec.expedite`): the
investigation gate skips the accumulation window and minimum age, and both schedulers rank its runs ahead of all
non-expedited work. Accumulation is a condition, not a phase — alerts fold in concurrently with enhancement.
Each edge has exactly one writer component; the transition table lives in `api/v1alpha1/transitions.go` and is
enforced by `SetPhase`.

### Isolation model

The agent pod is the least-trusted component and holds **no credential of any kind** — not even in the init
container, and for the default (claude) runner not even a model key. The repository arrives as a digest-verified
tarball from source-controller over the cluster network; claude model traffic goes through the egress credential
broker, authenticated by an audience-bound projected ServiceAccount token — an identity document, not a
capability — so the broker (a trusted Deployment) is where the model credential or cloud workload identity
lives, and claude egress collapses to DNS + the artifact server + the broker, all cluster-local. The optional
The claude pod does carry one fixed, non-secret placeholder `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`
(`patchy-brokered-placeholder`), set only by patchy, because the CLI refuses to start without some token; the
broker strips it with every other inbound credential header. The optional
non-brokered runners (codex/copilot) still carry their one model key, with NetworkPolicies (plus optional
Cilium FQDN / Istio allowlists) restricting their egress to their model APIs. All GitHub side effects — issue
projection, alert dismissal, branch push, pull requests — happen controller-side with short-lived,
per-repository scoped tokens.

### Evaluation execution (optional)

The same machinery optionally executes **remote skill evaluations** for evolve, patchy's sibling
coding-agent-evaluation tool. The division of knowledge is strict: evolve owns every evaluation semantic —
specs, grading, the LLM judge, baselines — co-located with the workspace inside the pod (the pod runs
`evolve exec-unit` from a per-harness evolve-runner image); patchy owns scheduling, sandboxing, and state.
`evolve` uploads a content-addressed workspace bundle (sha256-deduplicated, cached by source-controller and
served from the same artifact endpoint agent pods already fetch from), submits an immutable `Evaluation` CR
(one `EvaluationUnit` child per skill × model × tier), and monitors an SSE stream; the evaluation controller
schedules units through the agent-Job machinery with bounded concurrency, parses the pod's `EVOLVE-EVENT:`
stdout stream, stamps bounded summaries onto unit statuses, and stores each unit's opaque results entry in a
per-unit ConfigMap that evolve reassembles into its local results files. Finished evaluations expire on a TTL.

The isolation model is unchanged: no credential of any kind in the pod (brokered claude authenticates at the
egress broker; the non-brokered runners carry only their model key), the workspace
arrives as a digest-verified tarball, and the per-harness egress policies apply to evaluation Jobs exactly as
to finding runs. Submitters authenticate with OIDC bearer tokens (`evolve login`, PKCE, no client secret) and
are authorized by RBAC alone — native create/get/delete on the `evaluations` resource.

## Projected labels

The tracking-issue projection stamps a trimmed, human-facing label vocabulary (rendered from the Finding; the CR
is the state):

```txt
security-source: "ghas"                          # the source handler that ingested the finding
security-advisory: <CWE#,CVE#,GHSA#>             # one label per advisory identifier
security-finding: "opened|enhanced|investigating|queued|remediating|in-review|remediated|awaiting-approval|dismissed|handed-off|failed"
security-severity: "low|medium|high|critical"
security-priority: "low|medium|high|critical"
security-recommendation: "remediate|ignore|manual"
```

Machine metadata that used to ride on labels — alert numbers, accumulation state, confidence, budgets, attempt
counts, per-stage token/cost accounting — lives on the custom resources (`kubectl get findings`,
`kubectl get investigations`, `kubectl get findingrollups`).
