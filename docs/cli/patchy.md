## patchy

Work with patchy security findings from the terminal

### Synopsis

patchy lists, inspects, reviews and acts on the custom resources that carry the
patchy pipeline's state machine.

It talks to the Kubernetes API with your own kubeconfig — never through a
controller or the status page — so what you can do is what your RBAC allows.
Run `patchy can-i` to see your grants.

### Options

```
  -A, --all-namespaces             work across every namespace
      --context string             kubeconfig context to use
  -h, --help                       help for patchy
      --kubeconfig string          path to the kubeconfig file
  -n, --namespace string           namespace to work in (default: the context's)
      --no-color                   disable colour and styling
  -o, --output string              output format: table, wide, json, yaml, name, or markdown (default "table")
      --request-timeout duration   timeout for a single API call (default 30s)
  -v, --verbose                    log what the CLI is doing to stderr
```
