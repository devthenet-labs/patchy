# egress-broker

The egress credential broker: a reconciler-less reverse proxy that agent pods send **all** claude model traffic through.
It is what makes claude agent pods fully credential-less — the pod carries only an audience-bound projected
ServiceAccount token, and the broker injects or signs the real model credential outbound. It also makes 3rd-party model
providers work: Amazon Bedrock, GCP Vertex AI, and Microsoft Foundry each get a route the claude CLI's documented
gateway mode points at, with the broker holding the cloud identity that authenticates the provider-native requests.

There is no in-pod credential mode for claude — claude-without-broker is not a configuration. The codex and copilot
runners (both disabled by default) keep their in-pod Secret channels; brokering them is future work.

## How a request flows

```text
agent pod (claude CLI)                 egress-broker (release ns)              upstream
  ANTHROPIC_BEDROCK_BASE_URL=            1. TokenReview(X-Patchy-Broker-Token)
    http://…-egress-broker:8080/bedrock  2. audit line (pod, route, path,        bedrock-runtime.<region>.amazonaws.com
  CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_BEDROCK_AUTH=1           status, duration — never bodies)     api.anthropic.com
  X-Patchy-Broker-Token: <projected      3. strip caller headers; SigV4-sign /   <region>-aiplatform.googleapis.com
    ServiceAccount token>                   inject key / attach OAuth token      <resource>.services.ai.azure.com
                                         4. stream the response back, flushing
                                            every write; SSE keep-alive pings
```

The caller token is validated via `TokenReview` (audience `patchy-egress-broker`; only
`system:serviceaccount:<agent-ns>:<agent-sa>` is accepted), its verdict cached briefly (`--verdict-ttl`, 1m) so the API
server sees one review per token, not one per request, and the header is stripped before anything is forwarded. The
audit identity — the calling pod's name — comes from the pod-bound token's claims.

## Routes and credentials

A route exists exactly when its identifying flag is set; at least one is required.

| Route        | Enable with                | Upstream (default)                               | Credential                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/anthropic` | `--anthropic-api-key-file` | `https://api.anthropic.com`                      | The mounted Secret file, read per request so rotation propagates without a restart; `--anthropic-auth key` injects it as `x-api-key`, `token` as an `Authorization` bearer (a `claude setup-token` OAuth token) |
| `/bedrock`   | `--bedrock-region`         | `https://bedrock-runtime.<region>.amazonaws.com` | SigV4, signed with the broker's ambient AWS identity (IRSA / EKS Pod Identity / env credentials)                                                                                                                |
| `/vertex`    | `--vertex-region` + `--vertex-project` | `https://<region>-aiplatform.googleapis.com`     | OAuth bearer from Application Default Credentials (GKE Workload Identity in-cluster), cached/refreshed; only requests naming that project and location (the region) are admitted                                  |
| `/foundry`   | `--foundry-resource`       | `https://<resource>.services.ai.azure.com`       | `--foundry-auth key`: `x-api-key` from a file; `entra`: a cached, auto-refreshed Entra bearer                                                                                                                   |

Cross-cutting behavior: responses stream back with an immediate flush per write; when an event-stream goes quiet for
`--sse-ping-interval` (30s) the broker injects a spec-legal `: ping` comment frame so intermediaries do not idle-close a
long thinking pause; the Bedrock route buffers request bodies (SigV4 signs a payload hash) up to `--max-request-bytes`
(10 MiB). Errors are emitted as Anthropic-style JSON error envelopes.

`/healthz` is liveness; `/readyz` additionally requires every configured route's credential source to be usable — a
missing Anthropic key file or unresolvable cloud credentials fail readiness. This replaces the job controllers' old
claude-Secret probing as "is the model credential present": the controllers enable the claude harness by configuration
and probe `readyz` advisorily at startup.

## Flags

`--listen-addr` (`:8080`), `--health-addr` (`:8081`), `--token-audience` (`patchy-egress-broker`), `--verdict-ttl`
(`1m`), `--sse-ping-interval` (`30s`; negative disables injection), `--agent-namespace` (`patchy-agents`),
`--agent-service-account` (`patchy-agent`), `--max-request-bytes` (`10485760`), plus the per-route flags above and their
`--<provider>-base-url` overrides. As everywhere, each flag is also the matching `PATCHY_*` environment variable.

## The controller side

The job controllers (and the evaluation controller, via the shared flags) point claude runners at the broker with
`--broker-url` — required whenever a claude runner is configured — and describe the provider with `--claude-provider`,
`--claude-provider-region`, `--claude-provider-region-prefix`, `--claude-provider-project-id`, `--claude-model-map`, and
`--claude-provider-env`. Canonical model ids stay canonical everywhere controller-side; the provider-specific
translation (Bedrock `us.anthropic.<model>` inference profiles, Vertex bare ids, Foundry deployment names) is rendered
into `PATCHY_MODEL_MAP` and applied in-pod. Bedrock and Vertex ids are derived per registry model; **Foundry has no
derivable ids**, so `--claude-model-map` must cover every claude-resolving allowlisted model and stage default — the
controllers refuse to start otherwise, which turns a would-be mid-run failure into a startup error.

## Workload identity

For bedrock/vertex/foundry-entra the broker's ServiceAccount is the cloud-identity attachment point, the same recipe as
the context-controller enhancers:

- **AWS (Bedrock)** — IRSA: annotate with `eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn`; or associate EKS Pod Identity and allow the
  agent's link-local endpoint (`169.254.170.23:80`) in `egressBroker.networkPolicy.extraEgress`. Scope the role to
  `bedrock:InvokeModel*`.
- **GCP (Vertex)** — GKE Workload Identity: annotate with `iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account`; the metadata server
  (`169.254.169.254:80`) may need an `extraEgress` rule on clusters that police link-local egress. Grant
  `aiplatform.endpoints.predict` (roles/aiplatform.user).
- **Azure (Foundry, Entra mode)** — Workload Identity: annotate with `azure.workload.identity/client-id` and add the
  `azure.workload.identity/use: "true"` pod label via `egressBroker.podLabels`. Grant Cognitive Services User.

Invoke-class permissions only — the broker needs to call models, never to manage them.

## Hardening posture

- RBAC: `create tokenreviews` is the broker's entire Kubernetes surface — no Secret API access (credential files are
  mounted volumes), no writes, no leases.
- The Deployment runs under the restricted Pod Security posture like every other patchy component: non-root 65532,
  read-only root filesystem, no capabilities.
- Its NetworkPolicy admits the proxy port from the agent namespace only, and egress to DNS, TCP 443, and the API server.
- Every request produces one audit log line — caller pod, route, method, path, status, duration, bytes — and never
  bodies or headers.
- In-cluster traffic to the broker is plaintext HTTP carrying an audience-scoped identity token, the same posture as the
  artifact server; broker TLS or mesh mTLS is a hardening follow-up.

## Known limitations

- Codex and copilot remain in-pod-credentialed (both ship disabled); routing them through the broker is a follow-up.
- Per-job budget metering at the broker is future work — budgets are enforced in-pod from the harness's streamed usage.
- Bedrock/Vertex runs may report no `total_cost_usd`; cost accounting then falls back to the registry's first-party
  rates, which approximates provider pricing.
