# evaluation-controller

The remote skill-evaluation engine, and an **optional** controller: deployments that never submit remote evaluations
simply do not run it. It serves the [evolve](https://github.com/bitwise-media-group/evolve)-facing HTTP API (workspace
upload, submission, snapshot, SSE monitoring, cancellation) and runs the reconcilers that expand each submitted
`Evaluation` into `EvaluationUnit` children, schedule them through the sandboxed agent-Job machinery with bounded
concurrency, collect each pod's result stream, and expire finished evaluations on a TTL.

```sh
evaluation-controller serve --namespace patchy --auth-config /etc/patchy/auth/config.yaml
```

The division of knowledge is strict: evolve owns every evaluation semantic (specs, grading, the LLM judge, baselines),
co-located with the uploaded workspace bundle inside the pod, which runs `evolve exec-unit` from a per-harness
evolve-runner image. Patchy owns scheduling, sandboxing, and state — it interprets only the pod's `result` and `fatal`
events; the finished results entry is opaque payload stored in a per-unit ConfigMap the client reassembles locally.

Credentials reuse the shared `--<harness>-secret{,-key,-env}` flags
([investigation-controller](investigation-controller.md)): one Secret per model vendor in the agents namespace,
whichever fleet exercises it. The evolve-runner images ship from the evolve repository
(`ghcr.io/bitwise-media-group/evolve-runner-<harness>`), pinned by the operator like today's agent images; a
submission's `clientVersion` is recorded and skew is warned, never enforced.

## Authentication configuration

`--auth-config` points at a YAML file, conventionally a mounted Secret (`patchy-evaluation-auth`, key `config.yaml`).
Unlike the status server there is **no unauthenticated posture** — every route except `GET /api/v1/auth/info` is
bearer-authenticated, so a missing or invalid file is a startup error.

```yaml
mode: oidc # none | oidc
oidc: # mode: oidc only
  issuerURL: https://sso.example.com
  clientID: evolve # the PUBLIC (PKCE) client evolve logs in as — no client secret
  # scopes: [openid, offline_access, profile, email, groups]
  claims: # claim NAMES, mapped onto the identity
    username: email
    groups: groups
```

`mode: none` (dev/e2e) short-circuits authentication with a fixed identity and bypasses authorization entirely.

`evolve login` needs zero OIDC configuration client-side: it reads `GET /api/v1/auth/info` (issuer, clientID, scopes)
and runs the authorization-code + PKCE flow against the issuer with a localhost redirect. The operator prerequisite is a
**public** OIDC client (no secret) allowing `http://127.0.0.1:*/callback` redirects.

## Authorization

Native Kubernetes RBAC on the `evaluations` resource is the entire authorization surface — no custom verbs, no
admission-policy involvement:

| Verb     | Grants                                          |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `create` | Submit evaluations and upload workspace bundles |
| `get`    | Read snapshots and stream the SSE monitor       |
| `delete` | Cancel an evaluation                            |

Bind users or SSO groups (as mapped by the claims configuration) to a role carrying those verbs — the kustomize base
ships an example tier (`patchy-evaluations-submitter` in `rbac.users.example.yaml`), and the chart renders one behind
`evaluationController.rbac.userRoles`.

## Workspace bundles

Bundles are content-addressed by sha256: `HEAD /api/v1/workspaces/{digest}` dedupes before upload,
`PUT /api/v1/workspaces/{digest}` streams the gzip tarball through to source-controller's NetworkPolicy-gated internal
endpoint (`:9791`), which verifies the digest before caching. The digest is also the fetch capability the agent pod
downloads the bundle with. Bundles unused for `--workspace-retention` (source-controller, default `168h`) are swept; a
needed-but-swept bundle settles its unit as `WorkspaceLost`, prompting the client to re-upload and resubmit.
