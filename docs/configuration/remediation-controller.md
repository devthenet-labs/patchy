# remediation-controller

Queue admission (approvals and revivals), the priority scheduler (bounded concurrency, aging against starvation),
remediation agent Jobs, the changeset push + pull request — the only place a forge **write** credential is exercised —
and the rollup/TTL loop, which makes it the one deleter of expired Findings.

```sh
remediation-controller serve --namespace patchy \
  --claude-agent-image ghcr.io/devthenet-labs/patchy/claude-agent-runner:v0.9.0 # match your installed release
```

| `--max-attempts`                   | `PATCHY_MAX_ATTEMPTS`                   | `2`              | Remediation attempts per finding before it fails                             |

| `--priority-aging-interval`        | `PATCHY_PRIORITY_AGING_INTERVAL`        | `24h`            | Wait per effective-priority point of aging boost                             |
| `--priority-aging-cap`             | `PATCHY_PRIORITY_AGING_CAP`             | `25`             | Maximum aging boost                                                          |
| `--priority-weight-severity`       | `PATCHY_PRIORITY_WEIGHT_SEVERITY`       | `0.3`            | Scheduling-priority weight of the scanner severity                           |
| `--priority-weight-exploitability` | `PATCHY_PRIORITY_WEIGHT_EXPLOITABILITY` | `0.3`            | Weight of the assessed exploitability                                        |
| `--priority-weight-likelihood`     | `PATCHY_PRIORITY_WEIGHT_LIKELIHOOD`     | `0.2`            | Weight of the assessed likelihood                                            |
| `--priority-weight-impact`         | `PATCHY_PRIORITY_WEIGHT_IMPACT`         | `0.2`            | Weight of the assessed impact                                                |
| `--finding-ttl`                    | `PATCHY_FINDING_TTL`                    | `336h` (14 days) | How long completed findings are kept before deletion; `0` keeps them forever |

The four weights combine the investigation's ratings into the 0–100 scheduling priority the queue sorts on (severity 30%
/ exploitability 30% / likelihood 20% / impact 20% by default).

## Agent Job flags

The same per-harness runner flags as the [investigation-controller](investigation-controller.md#agent-job-flags):
`--claude-agent-image` / `--codex-agent-image` / `--copilot-agent-image` / `--fake-agent-image`, `--harnesses`, the
broker/provider flags for the brokered claude runner (`--broker-url`, `--claude-provider*`, `--claude-model-map`),
per-harness credential triples for the non-brokered runners (`--codex-secret{,-key,-env}`,
`--copilot-secret{,-key,-env}`), `--agent-namespace`, `--agent-service-account`, `--job-deadline`, `--job-ttl`. Each
non-brokered `--<harness>-secret-env` is validated against the credential env vars that harness accepts (codex:
`OPENAI_API_KEY` / `CODEX_API_KEY` / `CODEX_ACCESS_TOKEN`; copilot: `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` / `GH_TOKEN` /
`GITHUB_TOKEN`) and the controller refuses to start on a mismatch, on a missing credential for an enabled non-brokered
harness, on a claude runner without `--broker-url`, on a foundry model map that misses a claude-resolving allowlisted
model, or on an allowlisted model no enabled harness can run. The flag's own `--help` enumerates the accepted set,
rendered from the harness definition, so it cannot drift from what the validation allows.

`--repository-images` and `--agent-ephemeral-storage` work exactly as on the investigation-controller (see
[repository-declared runner images](investigation-controller.md#repository-declared-runner-images)): the remediation
runs the image the Repository pinned, under the same conditions, probe and pull-failure handling.

| Flag                        | Env                              | Default | Purpose                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--repository-images`       | `PATCHY_REPOSITORY_IMAGES`       | `false` | Run a Repository's pinned repository-declared image (brokered claude runner only); the kill switch                                        |
| `--agent-ephemeral-storage` | `PATCHY_AGENT_EPHEMERAL_STORAGE` | —       | Ephemeral-storage request and limit on both agent containers (e.g. `8Gi`); **required** with `--repository-images`                        |
| `--changeset-max-entries`   | `PATCHY_CHANGESET_MAX_ENTRIES`   | `500`   | Most files (upserts plus deletes) a changeset from a repository-image run may touch; more is rejected before any forge call (must be > 0) |

## Stage flags

The investigation report requests its own model, turn count, and token budget for the fix — but the turn and token
figures are an **estimate**, not a request that can be granted downward. They never shrink a run.

The budget has three levels:

- **Ceiling** (`--remediate-max-turns`, `--remediate-token-budget`) — what every remediation gets, whatever the
  investigation predicted and including when it predicted nothing. It is also the **approval threshold**: an estimate
  above it holds the finding in `AwaitingApproval` rather than queueing it.
- **Hard cap** (`--remediate-max-turns-hard`, `--remediate-token-budget-hard`) — the absolute limit. Approving an
  over-ceiling estimate _grants that estimate_, so the hard cap bounds what a single approval can authorize. It must be
  at or above the ceiling; the runner refuses to start otherwise.
- **Estimate** — advisory. Its only operational effect is the approval gate; everything else it does is reporting
  (estimate against granted against actual on the run, and the skew averages in the rollups, which feed back into the
  next investigation's prompt).

The model suggestion is still clamped: the spawner holds it to the allowlist and resolves the harness that runs it (the
model's provider decides the runner image and credential). `--remediate-model` is the canonical fallback when the
report's suggestion is missing or off the allowlist; its harness is derived from it.

| Flag                            | Env                                  | Default                     | Purpose                                          |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `--model-allowlist`             | `PATCHY_MODEL_ALLOWLIST`             | canonical ids               | Canonical model ids remediation may run          |
| `--remediate-model`             | `PATCHY_REMEDIATE_MODEL`             | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-5` | Canonical default when the report requests none  |
| `--remediate-timeout`           | `PATCHY_REMEDIATE_TIMEOUT`           | `45m`                       | Wall-clock limit for the remediation stage       |
| `--remediate-max-turns`         | `PATCHY_REMEDIATE_MAX_TURNS`         | `80`                        | Turns every run gets; approval threshold above   |
| `--remediate-token-budget`      | `PATCHY_REMEDIATE_TOKEN_BUDGET`      | `400000`                    | Output tokens every run gets; approval threshold |
| `--remediate-max-turns-hard`    | `PATCHY_REMEDIATE_MAX_TURNS_HARD`    | `240`                       | Most turns an approval can grant                 |
| `--remediate-token-budget-hard` | `PATCHY_REMEDIATE_TOKEN_BUDGET_HARD` | `1200000`                   | Most output tokens an approval can grant         |

Token budgets are enforced live — the runner watches the harness's streamed usage events and kills the process group
when the cumulative output-token count is exceeded; the harness CLI has no such flag itself.

## Behavior

- **Queue admission** — `AwaitingApproval → Queued` and `HandedOff → Queued` on an accepted approval (`spec.approval`,
  written by the status page, the CLI, or the integration-controller's projection once a `/patchy approve` on the
  tracking issue is authorised).
- **Scheduling** — `Queued → Remediating` when a slot frees, highest effective priority first; waiting findings gain +1
  effective priority per `--priority-aging-interval` up to `--priority-aging-cap`, so low-priority work cannot starve.
  Each grant creates one immutable `Remediation` child and its agent Job.
- **Verification, then push** — the agent's `commit.sh` must run cleanly and leave real commits; the controller then
  replays the changeset through the GitHub Git Data API (blob → tree → commit → ref) onto the `patchy/<finding>` branch
  with a scoped write token — no git binary, no clone — opens the pull request, and moves the finding to `InReview`. A
  recoverable failure re-queues (`Remediating → Queued`) within `--max-attempts`; exhaustion is `Failed`.
- **Changeset validation** — before any forge call, every changeset is checked against what a legitimate run produces:
  its base must be the Repository's pinned commit (`status.resolvedSHA`), every path relative and git-shaped (no empty,
  `.` or `..` component, nothing under `.git/`, no NUL, valid UTF-8, at most 4096 bytes), and every upsert a regular,
  executable or symlink mode with base64 content. A run held to the repository-image rules — it, or the investigation
  whose report it acts on, ran a repository-declared image — is also refused more than `--changeset-max-entries`
  entries, a control character in a path, and any change under `.github/workflows/` or `.github/actions/`, because a
  pushed branch triggers CI with the repository's secrets before a human has read it. A refused changeset fails the
  attempt `changeset_rejected` with the reason on the finding, and no forge call is made. Default-image runs keep the
  last three unchecked, so upgrading with repository images off changes nothing.
- **Rollups and the TTL** — on terminal-phase entry the stage statistics are aggregated exactly-once (finalizer-backed)
  into the per-scope `FindingRollup` objects; completed findings older than `--finding-ttl` are deleted, and the rollups
  remain the durable record.
