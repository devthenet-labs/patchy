# status-server

The status page backend: the embedded web dashboard over the `Finding` state machine and the `FindingRollup` statistics,
the sign-in surface, and the three human actions (approve, suspend, resume). It is a server, not a controller — it runs
no reconcilers and takes no leases; a controller-runtime cache gives it live watches, and an SSE stream tells open
browsers to refetch when anything changes.

```sh
status-server serve --namespace patchy --auth-config /etc/patchy/auth/config.yaml
```

The exposure contract is deliberately asymmetric — see [the status page](../status-ui.md) for the UI tour and the RBAC
grammar:

- **Rollup statistics are public.** `GET /api/rollups` (and the SSE stream) serve without a session.
- **The findings surface always requires authentication.** `GET /api/findings` (the trimmed list projection),
  `GET /api/findings/{name}` (one finding's full detail — description, alerts, enrichments, the phase log, and the run
  reports the list omits), and every action `POST` demand a signed-in identity whose RBAC passes the corresponding
  access review. With no auth config at all the server runs in the _unconfigured_ posture: rollups only, and the page
  explains that sign-in is not configured.
- **Agent conversations ride the findings gate.**
  `GET /api/findings/{name}/runs/{investigation|remediation}/{attempt}/transcript` is Server-Sent Events in both modes:
  a finished run replays its stored ConfigMap, a running one streams from the agent's pod log. Following a live run
  needs `pods` and `pods/log` read in `--agent-namespace` (through the API server — the server never dials an agent
  pod); without that grant, completed runs' conversations still serve. See
  [Agent conversations](../status-ui.md#agent-conversations).

## Flags

The [shared flags](index.md#shared-flags-every-controller) (`--listen-addr` is the page's own address here — there is no
webhook), plus:

| Flag                | Env                      | Default         | Purpose                                                                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--namespace`       | `PATCHY_NAMESPACE`       | `POD_NAMESPACE` | Namespace the Findings and FindingRollups live in                                    |
| `--agent-namespace` | `PATCHY_AGENT_NAMESPACE` | `patchy-agents` | Namespace the agent Jobs run in; live conversations are followed from their pod logs |
| `--kubeconfig`      | `PATCHY_KUBECONFIG`      | in-cluster      | Kubeconfig path for running outside the cluster                                      |
| `--health-addr`     | `PATCHY_HEALTH_ADDR`     | `:8081`         | healthz/readyz probe listen address                                                  |
| `--auth-config`     | `PATCHY_AUTH_CONFIG`     | _(unset)_       | Mounted authentication config; absent ⇒ rollups-only (see below)                     |

## Authentication configuration

`--auth-config` points at a YAML file, conventionally a mounted Secret (`patchy-status-auth`, key `config.yaml` — the
deployments mount it `optional`, so removing the Secret degrades to rollups-only rather than failing the pod). A
present-but-invalid file is a startup error: a broken configuration never silently downgrades to no authentication.

```yaml
mode: oidc # none | anonymous | oidc
sessionDuration: 168h # absolute session lifetime (default 7 days)
# insecure: true               # separate non-Secure cookies — plain-HTTP local dev ONLY
anonymous: # mode: anonymous only
  username: status-viewer
  groups: [patchy-viewers]
oidc: # mode: oidc only
  issuerURL: https://sso.example.com
  clientID: patchy-status
  clientSecret: "..." # or clientSecretFile: /path/to/projected/key
  # scopes: [openid, offline_access, profile, email, groups]
  # authURLParams: {}        # extra authorize-endpoint query parameters
  # autoLogin: false         # bounce straight to the provider instead of the sign-in panel
  # redirectURL: ""          # override the derived <scheme>://<host>/oauth2/callback
  claims: # claim NAMES, mapped onto the identity
    username: email # the subject access reviews run for
    groups: groups
    displayName: name
```

### Modes

- **`none`** — every request is a fixed development identity with authorization bypassed entirely. The dev overlay ships
  this; never expose it.
- **`anonymous`** — every request is the one configured identity, but access reviews still run: cluster RBAC for that
  username/groups decides what every visitor may see and do.
- **`oidc`** — the real SSO flow. The server itself is the OAuth2 client (authorization-code + PKCE); the SPA never sees
  a token.

### Sessions and cookies (mode `oidc`)

There is no server-side session store. The ID token, refresh token, and session start are sealed with AES-256-GCM — the
key is derived (HKDF-SHA256) from the OIDC client secret, so **rotating the client secret signs everyone out** — and
stored in chunked `HttpOnly` cookies (`__Host-patchy-auth`, `__Host-patchy-auth-1`, …). Every request re-verifies the ID
token; an expired token is renewed via the refresh token in place, but never past `sessionDuration` from the original
sign-in. Three small SPA-readable cookies carry no secrets: `__Host-patchy-auth-provider` (how sign-in works),
`__Host-patchy-auth-error` (the last failure), `__Host-patchy-auth-logout` (pauses `autoLogin` after an explicit
sign-out).

All production cookies, including the short-lived `__Host-patchy-oauth2-state` CSRF cookie, use `Secure`, `Path=/` and
no `Domain`. The browser-enforced `__Host-` prefix prevents a sibling preview host from injecting a parent-domain cookie
with the same name. Expiry and SPA deletion use the same attributes. See the
[cookie prefix requirements](https://httpwg.org/http-extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis.html#name-the-__host-prefix).

Upgrading from the old unprefixed names requires signing in again; an in-flight sign-in must also restart. Legacy
cookies are never accepted as a fallback. Old host-only cookies are expired when encountered, including the old OAuth
state's `/oauth2/` path. Parent-domain cookies cannot be reliably identified from a request and remain ignored.

For explicit `insecure: true` local development over **HTTP only**, both server and SPA use separate `patchy-dev-*`
names without `Secure`. Production never reads these names. Do not set `insecure` behind an HTTPS ingress; the SPA
selects its cookie namespace from the browser's protocol, while the server uses operator configuration, not forwarded
headers.

The callback URL is derived from `X-Forwarded-Proto` / `X-Forwarded-Host` (or the Host header), which assumes a trusted
fronting proxy — set `oidc.redirectURL` explicitly if yours cannot be trusted to strip those.

## Authorization

Per-user grants are ordinary Kubernetes RBAC, resolved server-side with `SubjectAccessReview`s for the signed-in user
(users need no kubeconfig and never talk to the API server):

- native `get` on `findings` gates **viewing** the findings surface;
- the **custom verbs** `approve`, `suspend`, `resume` on `findings.patchy.bitwisemedia.uk` gate the action buttons, one
  verb per button.

Grants are namespace-scoped and stamped into the payload as each finding's `userActions`; the client intersects them
with the finding's own state machine, and every `POST` is re-checked server-side. See
`deploy/kustomize/base/rbac.users.example.yaml` for ready-made viewer / approver / operator tiers.

The server's own ServiceAccount is deliberately narrow: `findings` read + **spec** write (approve records
`spec.approval`; suspend/resume toggle `spec.suspend` — it never writes `findings/status` and never moves a phase; the
owning controllers react to the spec change), `findingrollups` read, and cluster-scoped `subjectaccessreviews create`
for the reviews.
