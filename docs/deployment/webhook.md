# Webhook exposure

A GitHub App has exactly **one** webhook URL, and GitHub POSTs every subscribed event to it. In patchy that URL points
at the **integration-controller** — the single internet-facing component and the only webhook receiver in the system:

```text
https://<webhook.host>/github/webhooks
```

Each delivery's HMAC signature is validated against the `webhookSecret` of your configured `Integration` resources
before anything else happens; a delivery no Integration's secret matches is rejected with `401`. There is no routing
tier and nothing to fan deliveries out to — scanner events are ingested into `Finding` resources and human signals
(issue close, `/patchy` commands, PR merge) are applied to them, all inside this one controller.

Two properties follow:

- **Losing a delivery is not losing work.** The webhook path carries ingestion and human-in-the-loop signals only;
  pipeline progress rides on the controllers' watch-driven reconcile loops, which no delivery can announce anyway
  ("accumulation closed", "older than an hour", "a slot freed"). A rejected delivery (`503` on a full queue, downtime)
  stays in GitHub's 30-day delivery log, and the [redelivery sweep](#missed-deliveries-the-redelivery-sweep) replays it.
- **Exposure needs nothing exotic.** Any plain Ingress or Gateway API implementation works as-is — no header matching,
  no rewrites, no mirroring. Only the provider webhook paths need exposing — `/github/webhooks`, plus
  `/google-cloud/webhooks`, `/wiz/webhooks`, and the `/generic/` prefix when those Integrations are configured; the
  probes stay cluster-internal on port 8081.

The credential story: the integration-controller holds no GitHub credential in its Deployment at all — the
`Integration`/`Forge` Secrets are read on demand through the Kubernetes API, and the components that exercise write
credentials (remediation-controller's push/PR) never face the internet.

## Missed deliveries: the redelivery sweep

GitHub does **not** retry a failed webhook delivery on its own — it records the attempt in the App's 30-day delivery log
and moves on. A delivery patchy never got a `2xx` to (receiver down, queue full, misconfigured secret) would otherwise
sit there until someone redelivers it by hand.

The integration-controller closes that gap when `spec.github.redelivery` is enabled on the Integration:

```yaml
spec:
  interval: 10m # the sweep rides the reconcile interval
  github:
    redelivery:
      enabled: true
      lookback: 24h # how far back each sweep scans (GitHub retains 30d)
```

Each sweep lists the App webhook's recent deliveries (app-level API — this needs **App credentials**, a PAT cannot see
the delivery log) and asks GitHub to redeliver every delivery whose attempts within the lookback all failed, up to three
attempts per delivery. Duplicates are harmless: the receiver dedups per delivery GUID and ingestion is idempotent. The
outcome lands on `status.redelivery` (scan size, redeliveries requested, truncation, last error).

The status page's user menu offers a **Replay deliveries** action (RBAC verb `replay`) that redelivers _everything_ in
the lookback window, including deliveries that already succeeded — paired with **Reset all data** (verb `reset`), it
re-runs the whole pipeline from ingestion, which is exactly what a demo wants. The button writes `spec.replay` on the
Integration; the controller performs the redelivery on its next reconcile.

Deliveries that never happened — alerts predating the App installation — are invisible to the sweep: there is nothing in
the delivery log to redeliver. Those are what the **manual backfill** exists for: a one-shot list-alerts walk that
ingests the provider's open alerts directly. Trigger it from the status page's configuration view, with
`patchy backfill <integration> [--repo owner/ ...]`, or by stamping `spec.backfill` on the Integration directly (RBAC
verb `backfill` on integrations). The walk honours an optional repository prefix filter, is bounded by a page budget
(`status.backfill.truncated` says when to re-run with a narrower prefix), and is idempotent — alerts that already have
findings simply fold in. See [the GitHub source](../integrations/sources/github.md) for the full semantics.

## Expose it

Enable one flavour under the chart's `webhook` value and point the App's webhook URL at
`https://<host>/github/webhooks`.

**Plain Ingress** (`webhook.ingress`) — works with any ingress controller:

```yaml
webhook:
  host: patchy.example.com
  ingress:
    enabled: true
    className: nginx
    tls:
      - secretName: patchy-webhook-tls
        hosts:
          - patchy.example.com
```

GitHub should always deliver over HTTPS — set `tls` (cert-manager annotations go in `webhook.ingress.annotations`) or
terminate TLS in front of the Ingress.

**Gateway API** (`webhook.httpRoute`) — one `HTTPRoute` that attaches to a `Gateway` you bring via `parentRefs`; TLS and
certificates are the Gateway listener's concern:

```yaml
webhook:
  host: patchy.example.com
  httpRoute:
    enabled: true
    parentRefs:
      - name: my-gateway
        namespace: gateway-system
        sectionName: https
```

## Managed platform notes

Nothing here is patchy-specific — the chart emits standard resources with no implementation-specific annotations of its
own (add what your controller needs via `webhook.ingress.annotations` / `webhook.httpRoute.annotations`) — but for
orientation:

- **GKE** — both flavours work out of the box: the built-in GKE Ingress (`gce` class), or the
  [GKE Gateway controller](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/gateway-api) (enable with
  `--gateway-api=standard`; Google manages the CRDs and controller) with a `gke-l7-*` Gateway.
- **EKS** — install the [AWS Load Balancer Controller](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/):
  its `alb` IngressClass covers the Ingress flavour, and its
  [GA Gateway API support](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/aws-load-balancer-controller-adds-general-availability-support-for-kubernetes-gateway-api/)
  (Gateway API CRDs installed alongside) covers `httpRoute`, provisioning an ALB with the certificate from ACM.
- **AKS** —
  [Application Gateway for Containers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/for-containers/overview)
  implements both the Ingress and Gateway APIs; enable its ALB Controller as an
  [AKS managed add-on](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/for-containers/quickstart-deploy-application-gateway-for-containers-alb-controller-addon)
  (requires workload identity and Azure CNI). The AKS _application routing_ add-on (managed NGINX) also covers the
  Ingress flavour.

Any other conformant implementation (ingress-nginx, Istio, Envoy Gateway, Cilium, ...) works the same way.

## Kustomize

The base ships the integration-controller Deployment and its ClusterIP Service (`patchy-integration-controller:8080`)
but deliberately no Ingress — put your environment's Ingress or Gateway in front of that Service in your own overlay.
The dev overlay exposes it two ways at once: NodePort 30079 (where a webhook tunnel — smee.io, ngrok,
`gh webhook forward` — or `mise run replay` should point) and a host-less, class-less Ingress for the same path that any
default ingress controller satisfies. On [Colima](colima.md) that Ingress is live out of the box.
