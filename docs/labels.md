# State machine & labels

The `Finding` custom resource is the authoritative state machine for one security finding. `api/v1alpha1` owns the phase
taxonomy and the legal transition table (`transitions.go`), every phase edge has exactly one writer component, and
`SetPhase` refuses illegal moves — a controller cannot accidentally invent a transition. Labels on the tracking issue
are a **one-way projection** of this state for humans and issue searches; nothing ever parses them back.

## Phases

`Finding.status.phase` walks the happy path
`Opened → Enhanced → Investigating → Queued → Remediating → InReview → Remediated`, with `AwaitingApproval` before
`Queued` when a human must approve, and `Dismissed` / `HandedOff` / `Failed` as the other terminal phases. `Queued` is a
real phase — remediation runs in priority order with bounded concurrency, so findings observably wait for a slot.

| Phase              | Meaning                                                                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Opened`           | Ingested from the first alert; accumulating, awaiting enhancement                       |
| `Enhanced`         | The enhancer chain ran; ownership / infrastructure context recorded                     |
| `Investigating`    | An `Investigation` child exists (the child create is the lease); analysis Job runs      |
| `AwaitingApproval` | Verdict is `remediate` but below the confidence threshold, or a breaking-change hold    |
| `Queued`           | Admitted to the remediation queue; waiting for a priority-ordered slot                  |
| `Remediating`      | A `Remediation` child holds a slot; the remediation Job runs                            |
| `InReview`         | Branch pushed, pull request open; humans review                                         |
| `Remediated`       | PR merged. **Terminal**                                                                 |
| `Failed`           | Retries exhausted, fatal stage outcome, or PR closed unmerged. **Terminal**             |
| `Dismissed`        | Investigation verdict `ignore`: alerts dismissed, issue closed. **Terminal**, revivable |
| `HandedOff`        | Verdict `manual`, or a human closed the tracking issue. **Terminal**, revivable         |

Terminal entry sets `status.completedAt`, which starts the [finding TTL](configuration/remediation-controller.md)
(default 14 days — the `FindingRollup` objects retain the statistics after deletion). `Dismissed` and `HandedOff` are
revivable terminals: reopening the issue moves `Dismissed → HandedOff`, and an approval (`/patchy approve` on the issue,
or the status page or CLI) moves `HandedOff → Queued`, clearing `completedAt` and cancelling the TTL.

## Legal transitions

Self-transitions are always legal no-ops; everything else is refused by `SetPhase`. Per-edge ownership means no phase
edge has two writers.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Opened : integration
    Opened --> Enhanced : context
    Enhanced --> Investigating : investigation (lease)
    Investigating --> Enhanced : retry revert
    Investigating --> Queued : verdict remediate, confident
    Investigating --> AwaitingApproval : low confidence / breaking hold
    Investigating --> Dismissed : verdict ignore
    Investigating --> HandedOff : verdict manual
    Investigating --> Failed : attempts exhausted
    AwaitingApproval --> Queued : approve
    Queued --> Remediating : scheduler grant
    Remediating --> Queued : retry re-queue
    Remediating --> InReview : branch pushed, PR open
    Remediating --> Failed : attempts exhausted
    InReview --> Remediated : PR merged
    InReview --> Failed : PR closed unmerged
    Dismissed --> HandedOff : issue reopened
    HandedOff --> Queued : approve revival
    Remediated --> [*]
    Failed --> [*]
```

Every non-terminal phase additionally has an edge to `HandedOff`, written by the integration-controller when a human
closes the tracking issue — a person can always pull a finding out of the machine's hands.

| `Dismissed` → `HandedOff`                                                              | integration-controller   | Human reopened the tracking issue                                    |

In review, only the finding's recorded PR settles it — the same number, in the finding's repository, from a branch
there, not a fork's. The PR body's `Fixes #N` closes the tracking issue as the PR merges, and the two deliveries arrive
in either order, so an issue closed during review is checked against the recorded PR: merged → `Remediated`, closed
unmerged → `Failed`. Still open, or unreadable (GitHub answers 404 or 403, or no PR is recorded) → `HandedOff`, but only
if GitHub still reports the tracking issue closed: a close and a quick reopen can be delivered reopen first. A PR close
from a repository other than the recorded one — renamed since — is confirmed against the recorded PR: merged or closed,
its outcome applies; still open or unreadable, nothing moves. A transfer to another owner is confirmed the same way only
while the Integration's credential can still read the repository under its old name (a public repository, or an App
installation on the old owner that still includes it); otherwise GitHub answers 404 and the finding stays `InReview` for
a human. Either close is kept on the finding as `ReviewClosePending` until GitHub answers, because GitHub never
redelivers a webhook it has already delivered — and while no issues-enabled Integration exists to read it through
(suspended, issues turned off, or deleted), the close waits for one.

## Conditions

Facts that are not phases ride on `status.conditions`. Accumulation is the important one: alerts keep folding into a
Finding **while** enhancement runs, so the window close cannot be a phase.

| Condition                                               | On                         | Meaning                                                                                                     |

Findings parked with `ForgeResolved: False` are re-queued automatically when `Forge` resources change. A finding can
also be paused by a human: `spec.suspend: true` halts pipeline progress until cleared.

## Watching it

```sh
kubectl get patchy -n patchy                        # every patchy kind, one shot
kubectl get findings -w                             # phase, severity, priority, verdict, live
kubectl get investigations                          # per-attempt analysis children (short name: inv)
kubectl get remediations                            # per-attempt remediation children (rem)
kubectl get findingrollups                          # the all-time statistics (fr)
kubectl describe finding <name>                     # conditions, phase log, enrichments, attempts
```

Machine metadata that used to ride on issue labels — alert numbers, accumulation state, confidence, budgets, attempt
counts, per-stage token/cost accounting — lives on these resources, nowhere else.

## The projected labels

The tracking-issue projection stamps a trimmed, human-facing vocabulary, rendered from the Finding by the
integration-controller (`internal/labels`). Every label is `<key>: <value>`, truncated to GitHub's 50-character cap; the
multi-valued advisory key emits one label per identifier. Patchy only touches labels in the `security-` namespace,
ignores foreign or malformed `security-*` labels, and does not manage label colors or descriptions.

| Key                       | Cardinality        | Values                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `security-source`         | single             | The source handler that ingested the finding, e.g. `ghas`, `gcp-scc`, `wiz-issues`, `wiz-defend`, or a generic Integration's name                                           |
| `security-advisory`       | multi (one per id) | The CWE/CVE/GHSA identifiers                                                                                                                                                |
| `security-finding`        | single             | The phase, kebab-cased: `opened`, `enhanced`, `investigating`, `queued`, `awaiting-approval`, `remediating`, `in-review`, `remediated`, `dismissed`, `handed-off`, `failed` |
| `security-severity`       | single             | `low` \| `medium` \| `high` \| `critical` (scanner-assigned)                                                                                                                |
| `security-priority`       | single             | `low` \| `medium` \| `high` \| `critical` (derived from the investigation)                                                                                                  |
| `security-recommendation` | single             | `remediate` \| `ignore` \| `manual` (the investigation verdict)                                                                                                             |

That is the whole list — the projection is deliberately small. Labels exist for issue searches and human triage; the CR
is the state, so no machine or usage labels exist on issues anymore.
