// Package jobs creates and observes the ephemeral Kubernetes Jobs that run
// agent-runner: one Job per Investigation/Remediation attempt,
// deterministically named, labelled by kind/owner/finding (the two job
// controllers share the agents namespace and filter on the kind label), and
// garbage collected via TTL plus an owner-referenced per-Job Secret.
//
// The Job shape carries the isolation model: no credential of any kind
// reaches the pod except the model API key. The init container fetches the
// repository as a digest-verified tarball from source-controller's artifact
// server and synthesizes the local git base; the per-Job Secret holds only
// the handoff markdown. Results come back on the agent container's stdout
// as envelope events, read once at Job completion. Brokered claude pods also
// carry a fixed, non-secret placeholder ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN (the CLI will not
// start without one); the egress broker strips it and injects the real key.
